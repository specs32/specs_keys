REV 1 (untested !!)

TKL keyboard based on an g80-3000HAD - my own design / layout from scratch

It runs (hopefully will) QMK firmware on an ATMega 32U4 
It has an USB-C jack and some LEDs for backlight (instead of an numlock led)

build with kicad nightly Version: (5.99.0-10004-g132ec37b56), release build
(jeez guys ... fix the track routing !)
